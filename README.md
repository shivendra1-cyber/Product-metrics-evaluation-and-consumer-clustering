# Project Title: Product Metrics Evaluation and Consumer Clustering

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to investigate the performance of our ecommerce website through the analysis of predefined metrics. Additionally, we will cluster users based on their activity and browsing behavior. This readme file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the methods used.

## Project Objectives
1. **Performance Evaluation**: To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our ecommerce website, we will analyze various predefined metrics, such as user engagement, conversion rates, bounce rates, and average session duration.

2. **User Clustering**: We will cluster users into distinct groups based on their activity and browsing behavior. This clustering will help us gain insights into different user segments, allowing us to tailor our strategies and offerings to each group's specific needs.

## Data Collection
To achieve our objectives, we will collect data from various sources, including website analytics tools, user logs, and purchase history. The data will encompass a range of user activities, such as page views, search queries, and transactions.

## Metrics Evaluation
We will evaluate the ecommerce website's performance using the following predefined metrics:

1. **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who make a purchase compared to the total number of visitors.

2. **Bounce Rate**: The percentage of users who leave the website after viewing only one page.

3. **Average Session Duration**: The average amount of time a user spends on the website during a single session.

4. **Cart Abandonment Rate**: The percentage of users who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase.

5. **User Engagement Score**: A composite metric that takes into account various aspects of user interaction, such as clicks, likes, and shares.

## User Clustering
To cluster users, we will employ various machine learning and data analysis techniques. These may include:

1. **K-Means Clustering**: A common method for partitioning users into distinct groups based on their behavior.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing dimensionality in the data to highlight significant factors influencing user behavior.

3. **Cluster Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters to understand the characteristics and differences among user groups.

## Next Steps
Our project will proceed as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the necessary data from website analytics tools and other relevant sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

3. **Metrics Evaluation**: Calculate and analyze the predefined metrics to assess the website's performance.

4. **User Clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to group users based on their activity and behavior.

5. **Interpretation and Insights**: Interpret the results, gain insights into user segments, and propose recommendations for improving the website's performance and user experience.

6. **Documentation**: Prepare a comprehensive report and documentation of the analysis and findings.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a deep understanding of our ecommerce website's performance and the segmentation of our user base. The insights gained from this analysis will help us optimize our strategies and offerings to better serve our customers and enhance their experience on the platform.
